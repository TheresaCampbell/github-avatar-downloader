# GitHub Avatar Downloader

## Problem Statement

Given a GitHub repository name and owner, download all the contributors' profile images and save them to a subdirectory, `avatars/`.

The user must create the `avatars/` subdirectory on their computer within the same folder where the project is found. Otherwise, the program doesn't know where to save the avatars.

## Expected Usage

This program should be executed from the command line, in the following manner:

`node download_avatars.js <repo owner's username> <repo name>`
